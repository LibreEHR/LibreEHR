We pursue grants to help fund the future development of LibreEHR.  To
apply for these grants, we need to estimate how many times this program 
is installed and how many practices are evaluating or using this software.
It would be awesome if you would email us at president@oemr.org if you
have installed this software. The more details about your plans with
this software, the better, but even just sending us an email stating you
just installed it is very helpful.
