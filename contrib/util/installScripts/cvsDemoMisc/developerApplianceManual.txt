I. Introduction

	The objective of this appliance is to simplify the process of
development in LibreEHR, and allows the developer to start with the most
recent development version of LibreEHR. Think of this as a portable and
disposable LibreEHR development environment.

	When starting the appliance for the first time, it will download,
install, and configure the development version of LibreEHR.  It will also place
a tarball and zip package of the development version to allow easy transfer to
other systems for testing etc.

	When shutting down the appliance, you have the option of
saving your changes or reverting back to the original state of appliance.


II. Instructions for use

	A. Start the appliance
		Start the appliance with VMware Player. If starting
	the appliance for the first time, it will download, install,
	and configure the development version of LibreEHR from
	Sourceforge. If it is not the first time, then it will just 
	startup. An intro screen will provide further instructions.

	B. Stop the appliance
		When shutting down the appliance, you have the option
	of saving your changes(select 'Just Power Off') or going
	back to the original state of appliance(select 'Revert to
	Snapshot'). Note that if you choose to 'Revert to Snapshot',
	your data will be lost!	

	C. Helpful tips
		-Note that the installed software is separate from
	the git directory. This is for a reason; active development
	should not happen in the installed software directory, which is
	/var/www/html/libreehr. The changes should be made in your local
        git repository at /home/libreehr/git/libreehr. The current 
        checked out copy of your git repository can be quickly tested
        via the refresh script in the /home/libreehr/git directory.
		-The SSH port is open for a reason; works for
	copy/paste and less awkward than using the VMWare console.
		-Jed or vim text editor works well.

	D. How this thing was built and how it works
		-For building instructions check out:
		   /home/libreehr/docs/HowThisApplianceWasBuilt.txt
		-On startup the /etc/rc.d/init.d/StartupDeveloperAppliance
	script is run, which first downloads the cvs version.  This script 
        then calls a script within LibreEHR libreehr/contrib/util/installScripts/cvsDemoInstall
	which then downloads the git development version, which it
        installs and configures LibreEHR from.
