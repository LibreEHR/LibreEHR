Laravel Installation : 
----------------------

For installation purpose, official docs at https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation followed. Below is brief instructions to follow for unix based systems.

Dependency:
-----------
1. PHP 7.0+
2. OpenSSL PHP Extension
3. PDO PHP Extension

Above will install laravel via Laravel Installer, but to have a global access we need to export its path. So for this, follow below instructions : 
1. Open your shell. (In my case bash shell)
2. open .bashrc
3. Add export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin" at the end of file. 
4. Run source ~/.bashrc
